= acts_as_audited

acts_as_audited is an ActiveRecord extension that logs all changes to your models in an audits table.

This fork addresses an issue that arises (apparently in the test environment only) in conjunction with restful_authentication. In this situation, restful_authentication provides the current_user method to the application controller as a mixin method, which does not get recognized by controller.respond_to?(:current_user).

== Installation

* Install the plugin into your rails app
  If you are using Rails 2.1+:

    script/plugin install git://github.com/Bantik/acts_as_audited.git

* Generate the migration
    script/generate audited_migration add_audits_table
    rake db:migrate

== Usage

Usage instructions from the master branch apply; the only difference is that if you are using the restful_authentication plugin, you need to add the following method to your application controller:

  def current_user_for_audit
    @current_user || current_user
  end

See http://github.com/collectiveidea/acts_as_audited/ for full details on the plugin.
